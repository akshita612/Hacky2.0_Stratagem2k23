## About the Project

This browser-based patient registration application allows patients to upload their details along with their scanned photo while being at their homes. On the patient's arrival at the hospital, only facial recognition is sufficient as registration information is already there in the app database. Face recognition at hospital also ensures that the patient is personally present and so token cab be issued for queuing outside the relevant room.  This little solution can save substantial time at the registration desk, thereby improving the overall efficiency and reduce patient's sufferings.
